In this project, the hardest challenges were the styling and deploying.
Even though I followed the exact way SmolJames did it, I had to change the settings to achieve the end result.

The other main challenge was deploying the code into githubpages. The problem was that Vite uses a folder called dist and the Github deployment scripts were looking for a build folder.
It as a very simple fix but it took me about 20 minutes of testing and troubleshooting to fix it.
The best solution was to change the package.json file scripts, replacing the build for a dist option so that the final app folder was detectable by the workflow.
